## XAML Syntax

## On Platform

When you want to render your UI differently on each platform you can use the `OnPlatform` XAML extension to run code for Android, iOS and UWP. An example is, on iOS, the content shows up right from the top and you might want to push it downloads 20points, but on Android and UWP content is displayed after the status bar or tool.
