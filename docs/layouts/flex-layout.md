description: Use FlexLayout for stacking or wrapping a collection of child views.

# Flex Layout

The Xamarin.Forms FlexLayout is new in Xamarin.Forms version 3.0. It is based on the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, commonly known as flex layout or flex-box, so called because it includes many flexible options to arrange children within the layout.

`FlexLayout` is similar to the Xamarin.Forms StackLayout in that it can arrange its children horizontally and vertically in a stack. However, the FlexLayout is also capable of wrapping its children if there are too many to fit in a single row or column, and also has many options for orientation, alignment, and adapting to various screen sizes.

`FlexLayout` defines six public bindable properties and five attached bindable properties that affect the size, orientation, and alignment of its child elements.
